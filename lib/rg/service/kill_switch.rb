module RG
class Service

  # Some services may need to be enabled or disabled for testing.
  # DRY up the boilerplate that makes this happen, so that service
  # classes may choose when to self-terminate as follows:
  #
  # def perform
  #   return if disabled?
  #   # side-effect-having code
  # end
  #
  # To turn a service on or off, call .enable! or .disable! on the
  # service class.  Including services will be enabled by default.
